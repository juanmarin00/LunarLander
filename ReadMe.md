This repository contains a DQN implementation of the lunarlander-V2 environment!

To run the code for this environment you will need to have the following libraries/packages installed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
PyTorch
gym

The code is split in two files for ease of use and re-implementation:

- Lunar_lander_DQN.py : This .py file contains all the code needed to run the DQN agents and other baseline results which we used in this project
- Lander_experiment_notebook.ipynb : This notebook has the code from the.py file in addition to all the code we ran during our experimentation. Users can inspect all of our tests with the corresponding results or re-run them with their own choice of parameters to further investigate the use of DQN for this environment.

A writeup for this project explaining all the experimentation and procedures taken is available upon request @ juan.m.c.2000@gmail.com
